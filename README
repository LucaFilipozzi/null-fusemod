What is it
==========

This is a standalone libfusemod_*.so example FUSE module that does
nothing.  Its purpose is to be used as a basis for real modules.

Caveat
======

There is a warning though: like all .so fusemods, it suffer from a
glibc bug described in:

http://www.sourceware.org/ml/libc-help/2013-07/msg00015.html
http://www.sourceware.org/ml/libc-help/2013-08/msg00005.html

and as such, the compiled module will fail to register correctly into
FUSE if FUSE has been compiled with -O2, until glibc is fixed.  As a
workaround, you can compile FUSE with -O0 (./configure CFLAGS=-O0).

Also, feel free to discuss this bug on the libc-help mailing list.

How to compile
==============

To produce libfusemod_null.so:

make FUSE_PREFIX=/toplevel/path/of/FUSE

The path must contain the include/ subdirectory containing fuse.h.

To clean: make clean

How to run
==========

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
fusexmp -o nonempty,modules=null test
